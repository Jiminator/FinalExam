            After Reddit purchased Alien Blue, users did not like the official iOS Reddit app, as it used a framework not specialized for iOS development. In response, former Apple intern Christian Selig released Apollo, a Reddit application designed for iOS using the Swift programming language. Because it was developed using Swift, Apollo used native gestures and performed better than its non-native counterpart. It achieved critical acclaim from its users and even got a shout-out from Apple executives.          </p>

            ChatGPT is released. Large language models like ChatGPT or GPT-4 require a lot of information to train on, and one of the most effective datasets to train a language model is Reddit data. With billion-dollar companies looking to profit from the data from Reddit for free, Reddit sees this as an opportunity to monetize their API.          </p>

            Christian attends a scheduled meeting with Reddit to discuss API pricing. Reddit reveals that the price will be a non-negotiable $12,000 for 50 million requests. Since the Apollo app goes through 7 billion requests per month, this pricing will cost Apollo $20 million annually, which is entirely unsustainable. Christian reveals the figure in a Reddit post, which triggers public outcry and an ugly back-and-forth between himself and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman.

            Steve Huffman's responses to Christian's post further ignite the anger of moderators. Moderators, deciding that their only leverage is the free labor they provide, agree to shut down their subreddits in protest. On June 12th, moderators shut down their subreddits one by one. Nine thousand subreddits instantly disappeared, and Reddit was reduced from a thriving hub on the internet to an absolute wasteland.

            Steve Huffman started to make appearances on different media outlets. He craftily frames the protest differently by portraying the protestors as a selfish vocal minority. He compares the subreddit moderators to inherited landowners who only care about their interests and are stopping their tenants, the users, from accessing the platform. He also defends the API pricing change by blaming AI companies for using their data to train language models. The move successfully neutralizes public support for the protests.

            The Verge got an internal memo that Reddit sent to moderators who still had their subreddits closed. In the message, Reddit threatened to reorganize the mod teams of any subreddit that refuses to reopen. Of course, this sparked fear in all moderators across Reddit.

            Christian Sellig announces in a Reddit post that Apollo has shut down. He thanks the community in the post for their support and talks about his journey with Apollo. Shortly after, the app no longer worked and was replaced with a new icon.

            For the rest of the week, Reddit continued to fight with the moderators. Reddit cracked down on the subreddits that would only post NSFW content and replaced the moderators when they weren't cooperative. In response, subreddits slowly started to open back up.
