            Christian attends a scheduled meeting with Reddit to discuss API pricing. Reddit reveals that the price will be a non-negotiable $12, 000 for 50 million requests. Since the Apollo app goes through 7 billion requests per month, this pricing will cost Apollo $20 million per year, which is completely unsustainable. Christian records the call, unbeknownst to Reddit.

            In a call with moderators, Reddit accuses Apollo of being inefficient and not using their API correctly. Reddit CEO, Steve Huffman, also claimed that Apollo does web scraping to deliver notifications faster but has "done no effort to be a good citizen of the internet".

            In a reddit post, Christian announces that Apollo will close down on June 30th after working on it full-time for eight years. In it, Christian reveals the API price tag, and also how relations with Reddit had soured.

          <p>
            Christian reveals that he recorded the call, and publishes the audio along with a transcript. In it, it is shown that Reddit initially interpreted Christian's wording of quite down as an offer to not cause any drama in exchange for $10 million dollars. However, Christian clarifies that "going quiet" was referring to stopping the API usage if they were bought by Reddit to reduce the opportunity cost of Apollo and thus cut a deal for $10 million at half-price. It is also clear that the Reddit employee heard the clarification and apologized for the misunderstanding.

            Steve Huffman releases a statement on the API changes. He reiterates the API pricing which has already been revealed by Christian. The post gets thousands of downvotes, and questions about Christian immediately start to flood in. Somebody asked why Reddit claimed they were being threatened and blackmailed. Steve claims that Christian has been dishonest and is very difficult to work with. This then prompted a reply from Christian, where he asks Steve to provide an examples of dishonesty or business misconduct.

            Christian posts the Apollo backend to debunk claims that Apollo is inefficient in its API usage. The Apollo backend is written in the Go programming language, which is have great performance.  Upon inspection, the app doesn't show any sort of major red flags in the way it's designed. Also provided was a documented trail of emails also showing Apollo, helping Reddit identify bugs, and maintaining good status on the API.
