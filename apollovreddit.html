            Christian attends a scheduled meeting with Reddit to discuss API pricing. Reddit reveals that the price will be a non-negotiable $12,000 for 50 million requests. Since the Apollo app goes through 7 billion requests per month, this pricing will cost Apollo $20 million annually, which is entirely unsustainable. Christian reveals the figure in a Reddit post, which triggers public outcry and an ugly back-and-forth between himself and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman.

            In a call with moderators, Reddit accuses Apollo of misusing their API. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman also claimed that Apollo does web scraping to deliver notifications faster but has "made no effort to be a good citizen of the internet."

            In a Reddit post, Christian announced that Apollo will close down on June 30th after working on it full-time for eight years. In it, Christian reveals the API price tag and how relations with Reddit soured.

          <p>
            Christian reveals that he recorded the call and published the audio and a transcript. It is shown that Reddit initially interpreted Christian's wording of entirely down as an offer not to cause any drama in exchange for $10 million. However, Christian clarifies that "going quiet" was referring to stopping the API usage if Reddit bought them to reduce the opportunity cost of Apollo and thus cut a deal for $10 million at half-price. It is also clear that the Reddit employee heard the clarification and apologized for the misunderstanding.

            Steve Huffman released a statement on the API changes. He reiterates the API pricing, which Christian has already revealed. The post gets thousands of downvotes, and questions about Christian immediately flood. Somebody asked why Reddit claimed they were being threatened and blackmailed. Steve claims that Christian has been dishonest and challenging to work with. This post prompted a reply from Christian, where he asked Steve to provide examples of dishonesty or business misconduct.

            Christian posts the Apollo backend to debunk claims that Apollo is inefficient in its API usage. The Apollo backend is written in the Go programming language and performs excellently. Upon inspection, the app doesn't show any significant red flags in its design. Also provided was a documented trail of emails showing Apollo, helping Reddit identify bugs, and maintaining good status on the API.          </p>
