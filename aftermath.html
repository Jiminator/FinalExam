        <h5>Protests die down.</h5>
        <p>
          Steven Huffman's public interviews and Reddit cracking down on the protesting subreddits quickly killed the movement. The interviews destroyed public support for the moderators' cause, and painted them as villains. Reddit's promise to go after the moderator teams killed the moderator's resolve by exploiting their own power-hungry nature. Reddit demonstrated their resolve to kill this protest by restructuring moderator teams of subreddits that switched themselves to NSFW in protest. As the time continued, many of the subreddit began to reopen due to public pressure or fear.

        <h5>Long-Term Effects</h5>
        <p>
          It is worth noting that Google announced that users were noticeable unsatisfied with the quality of their search results due to the the Reddit blackout. However, it is clear from the data the protest didn't change anything the in the long run.Traffic quickly returned to normal after the initially agreed upon two days. Only 11 subreddits still remain in blackout.

        <h5>Lessons Learned and Implications</h5>
          <p>
            The protest itself is an interesting case study on human nature. At the end of the day, the redditors lacked the resolve that Reddit had. The protest was very successful in its initial phase. However, Reddit managed to correctly assess the nature of their opponents, and knew that the protest will run out of steam when moderators grew fearful of their position. By exploiting the moderators' self-interest and feelings of self-importance, Reddit managed to successfully employ tradition union busting tactics-against a group of volunteers.

            One of the biggest assets that Reddit owns is the community data. Think about how often you will put "reddit" at the end of a Google search to get better results. With that in mind, is Reddit's data worth 20 million dollars? It is understandable that Reddit would want to profit from selling data to billion-dollar companies for training large language models. However, this exorbitant pricing is fatal to the people that use their APIs the most, which are third party app developers who help users better connect with their communities. While Reddit framed AI as an easy scapegoat, this real purpose of this pricing change is to wipe out user-share of third-party apps.

            Developers can also learn a lot from this event. In hindsight, Apollo was always incredibly exposed as it really was just Reddit with a clean interface. Developers must be aware of the dangers of developing a product that heavily relies on a single source or API they cannot control. It is not uncommon for businesses to provide a free or a very cheap API to developers so that they can integrate their tools deeply into their own products and then jack up the prices significantly because it is easier to pay than to refactor.

            This protest also sets a terrifying precedent for corporations, and they may realize their community may have less leverage than initially assumed. Reddit has shown that a company can survive while losing both their community and content providers. Companies will now be able to study tactics Reddit employed, reducing the effectiveness of all future protests. It is also worth noting that Reddit's plan to get rid of third-party apps was successful. Companies may also take note of how the downloads of Reddit's app skyrocketed after the API changes went into effect, leading companies to be more hostile to third-party app developers in the future.
