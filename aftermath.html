        <h5>Protests Die Down</h5>
        <p>
          Steven Huffman's public interviews and Reddit cracking down on the protesting subreddits quickly killed the movement. The discussions destroyed public support for the moderators' cause and painted them as villains. Reddit's promise to go after the moderator teams killed the moderator's resolve by exploiting their power-hungry nature. Reddit demonstrated its resolve to kill this protest by restructuring moderator teams of subreddits that switched themselves to NSFW in protest. As time continued, many subreddits began reopening due to public pressure or fear.

        <h5>Long-Term Effects</h5>
        <p>
          It is worth noting that Google announced that users were noticeably unsatisfied with the quality of their search results due to the Reddit blackout. However, it is clear from the data the protest didn't change anything in the long run. Traffic quickly returned to normal after the initially agreed upon two days. Only 11 subreddits remain in blackout.

        <h5>Lessons Learned and Implications</h5>
          <p>
            The protest itself is an interesting case study of human nature. The Redditors lacked the resolve that Reddit had. The demonstration was very successful in its initial phase. However, Reddit managed to assess the nature of their opponents correctly and knew that the protest would run out of steam when moderators grew fearful of their position. By exploiting the moderators' self-interest and feelings of self-importance, Reddit successfully employed traditional union-busting tactics against a group of volunteers.

            Developers can also learn a lot from this event. In hindsight, Apollo was always incredibly exposed as it was just Reddit with a clean interface. Developers must know the dangers of developing a product that heavily relies on a single source or API they cannot control. It is not uncommon for businesses to provide a free or very cheap API to developers so that they can integrate their tools deeply into their products and then jack up the prices significantly because it is easier to pay than to refactor.

            This protest also sets a terrifying precedent for corporations, and they may realize their community may have less leverage than initially assumed. Reddit has shown that a company can survive while losing its community and content providers. Companies can now study Reddit's tactics, reducing the effectiveness of all future protests. It is also worth noting that Reddit's plan to eliminate third-party apps was successful. Companies may also note how the downloads of Reddit's app skyrocketed after the API changes went into effect, leading companies to be more hostile to third-party app developers in the future.
