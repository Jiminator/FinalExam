            On the first day, Reddit was almost unusable. As most of the subreddits went private, almost all of Reddit's content was hidden. Even Google mentioned how search results have been awful during the days that the Reddit blackout was happening. Some subreddits turned on NSFW so they can prevent ads from being shown in the subreddit. A war between the platform and the platform owners has kicked off, and it is now Reddit's turn to respond.

            The Verge obtains an internal memo that Steve Huffman shared to Reddit staff. In this memo, Steve Huffman lets employees know the current situation, and that most of Reddit will come back by Wednesday. Steve also claims that like all the previous blowups at Reddit, this one will pass as well. What was also interesting was that the memo explained that while Apollo plans to  shut down, Reddit was in talks with other third-party tools, and that two accessibility-focused third-party apps were made exempt from the new API pricing changes. The dismissive tone of the memo escalated the situation, and many subreddits announced an indefinite blackout with no ending date in sight. This happening during times of peak Reddit traffic like the NBA finals or the collapse of the Philadelphia Interstate 95. Reddit's new goal was to redirect the anger from users onto the moderators shutting down the website.

            Reddit brings back r/place, a big digital mural that allows communities to mark their presence before getting erased. Reddit brings it back in an attempt to remind users why they love Reddit. However, the community uses it as an opportunity to protest, writing the words 'Fuck Spez' (Spez is the username of the Steve Huffman) multiple times in mural.
